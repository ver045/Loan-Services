# OVERVIEW
We identified a problem users face when applying for a loan through loan service companies. 
The problem is that when an applicant applies for a loan, part of the process is going through credit checking, or credit inquiries,
which ultimately affects the applicant's credit score. That being said, we came up with a solution by building a user-friendly service
that eliminates these credit inquiries in which a loan applicant simply inputs non-identifyable but relevant information to estimate 
their interest rate of that loan.

The information needed is:
- loan amount
- annual income
- credit score
- home ownership status (rent, own, mortgage status)
- loan terms ( 12, 24, 36 month repayment plan)
